## Building

CMake is used to build the project. If you're using an IDE, it may be able to detect the source tree and build settings automatically. No outside libraries are currently used, so most (if not all) systems should be good to go.

To build, make sure you have the following:
* CMake 3.0 or greater

### Building on *NIX systems

1. Make a new directory called "build" in the project root. 
2. Move into that directory and run `cmake ..`. This will generate a makefile.
3. Run `make`. Optionally, if you have extra CPU cycles to spare, you can use `make -jX`, where X is the number of CPUs you have.
4. If everything built successfully, you can run it by typing `./tumblrcards` in your terminal.

### Building on Windows systems

Coming soon. For now build using Cygwin, MinGW, Linux Subsystem for Windows, or the like and follow the "Building on *NIX systems" instructions above.
